        <h2>Home</h2>
        <P>My name is Yvonne Ndungu. I love God and everything about him. I also love my family members as they are my world.</P>
        <P>I'm the firt born daughter and this title comes with a lot of responsibilities. This means you have to be the most responsible child in the family 'the pride of the family' meaning you are the most disciplined and given no room for mistakes.</P>
        <p>Being the first born has its ups and downs and one downside of it is trying to navigate life on your own as there are no older siblings to guide you on so many things in life. The bright side about that is that you are able to learn and unlearn things in life and this comes with great lessons.</p>
        <p>I've learnt to lead and set the pace for my siblings as well as be a role model to them. I don't have an regrets about being a first born as i've learnt to appreciate is more as time goes by.</p>
        <P>I'm all about 4 G's, God,Goals,Growing and Glowing. I'm a girl boss and i go for the life I want (whatever doen't kill you makes you stronger)</P>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <P>While in school I found an interest in coding and I picked it from a friend who was doing IT in our school. I'm from the infamous JKUAT and that's where i had been studying until last year December. I've studied bachelors of science in Entrepreneurship. I love the business industry and this desire sparked from my dad as I consider him one of the best business man i will ever come across. I studied entrepreneurship as i have loved accounting and finance since highschool. I also love the real estate industry as it has high potential as time goes by.</P>
            <P>I decided to study software engineering as i believe i can be able to intergrate it with the entrepreneurship world. It so much potential in the business industry and it proves it could be futile for our geneation to come.</P>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <h3>Techical skills</h3>
            <h4>Accounting</h4>
            <P>I was able to practise my accounting skills in NHIF where i was attached for a period of 3 months. I was taken to the accounts department and woked on accounts receivable and payable. </P>
            <h3>Non-technical skills</h3>
            <h4>Communication</h4>
            <p>I'm not the best communicator but i've been able to learn how to make a good coversation with people by having good listening skills while they are talking and giving them time to air their opinions without interrupting them. This has helped me so much as it enables me be able to feel satisfied with a good coverstation.
